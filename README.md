Tamil Brahmi Letter "அ" Dataset

This dataset provides a collection of images depicting the Tamil Brahmi letter "அ" (a) throughout its historical evolution. It encompasses variations of the letter from its earliest known forms on stone sculptures to its modern representation in the Tamil script.

Data Structure:
-RAW Folder:Contains the original, unprocessed images of the letter "அ" as extracted from stone inscriptions.
-Processed Folders:Organized into 15 subfolders, each representing a distinct period or style of the letter "அ". This allows for the study of its evolution over time.

Data Processing:

Image Cleaning: Images in the processed folders have undergone basic preprocessing steps such as:
    * Noise reduction 
    * Contrast enhancement
    * Background removal 

Data Augmentation:To enhance the dataset's diversity and improve model robustness, data augmentation techniques may have been applied, including:
    * Rotations
    * Scaling
    * Applying Filters

Current Scope & Future Directions:
  -Current Focus: Currently limited to the letter "அ," this dataset serves as a foundation for a more extensive collection.
  -Expansion: Future plans include expanding the dataset to encompass all letters of the Tamil alphabet, capturing a wider range of historical periods and styles. 

Potential Applications:

This dataset can be valuable for research and development in various fields:
Historical Linguistics: Analyzing the evolution of the Tamil script and its historical context.
Computer Vision: Developing and testing algorithms for character recognition, image classification, and style transfer.
Machine Learning: Training models for tasks such as character generation, style classification, and anomaly detection.
